This file describes the columns of MAF files generated by maf2maf or vcf2maf,
and how to interpret them, especially in the context of cancer genetics.

The first 34 columns are NCI's Mutation Annotation Format (MAF), described here:
https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data/File_Formats/MAF_Format/

The subsequent 10 columns are relevant to most analyses.

35. HGVSc - the coding sequence of the variant in HGVS recommended format
36. HGVSp - the protein sequence of the variant in HGVS recommended format
37. HGVSp_Short - Same as HGVSp, but using 1-letter amino-acid codes
38. Transcript_ID - transcript onto which the consequence of the variant has been mapped
39. Exon_Number - the exon number (out of total number)
40. t_depth - read depth across this locus in tumor BAM
41. t_ref_count - read depth supporting the reference allele in tumor BAM
42. t_alt_count - read depth supporting the variant allele in tumor BAM
43. n_depth - read depth across this locus in normal BAM
44. n_ref_count - read depth supporting the reference allele in normal BAM
45. n_alt_count - read depth supporting the variant allele in normal BAM

The next column is relevant to analyses that consider the effect of the variant on all alternate
isoforms of the gene, or on non-coding/regulatory transcripts. The effects are sorted first by
transcript biotype priority, then by effect severity, and finally by decreasing order of transcript
length. Each effect in the list is in the format [SYMBOL,Consequence,HGVSp,Transcript_ID,RefSeq].

46. all_effects - a semicolon delimited list of all possible variant effects, sorted by priority

To distinguish driver mutations from passenger mutations, the most relevant columns are:

51. Consequence - consequence of this variant (http://useast.ensembl.org/info/genome/variation/predicted_data.html#consequences).
      This may contain multiple terms that are comma-separated. For example, a synonymous mutation might be close enough to an intron
      to alter splicing. VEP will report both "synonymous_variant" and "splice_region_variant" in this column, for such variants.
93. IMPACT - the severity of the consequence (http://useast.ensembl.org/Help/Glossary?id=535). "HIGH" means severe effect on gene.
86. CLIN_SIG - clinical significance of variant per ClinVar (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/clinsig/). Find important
      variants by looking for tags like pathogenic, likely_pathogenic, or drug_response.
88. PUBMED - pubmed ID(s) of publications that cite existing variant. Some of these pubs are crap, but a few are gold mines.

These are some other columns to help shortlist variants worth looking into:

57. Existing_variation - known identifier of existing variation. If the variant was seen in some
      other somatic/germline DB, its ID will be listed here.
72. SIFT - the SIFT prediction and/or score, with both given as prediction (score).
73. PolyPhen - the PolyPhen prediction and/or score.
109. FILTER - False-positive filtering status, copied from the input MAF/VCF. An additional filter
      named common_variant is also appended, if allele frequency across at least one gnomAD subpopulation
      is >0.04% (this cutoff can be changed when running vcf2maf or maf2maf). So if you're handling
      somatic variants, the common_variant tag means this is likely a false-positive. It is less
      likely to be a legit somatic variant at a site that gnomAD classifies as germline.
